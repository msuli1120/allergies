An allergy score is a single number that tells what someone is allergic to. The scores for each allergen are:
allergen     score
eggs         1
peanuts      2
shellfish    4
strawberries 8
tomatoes     16
chocolate    32
pollen       64
cats         128
So if someone is allergic to eggs and strawberries, they get a score of 9.

 running allergies(3) should print a list of the person's allergies (eggs and peanuts) to the screen.
